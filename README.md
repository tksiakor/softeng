## Purpose
This Application is to be used to log into Ashesi's courseware and pull all subject timetable and sync with 
a smart devices calender. This will enable reminders to be set in place for every academic instance of assignment,
test and class. 

## Scenario
In Ashesi University, students are not able to keep up with assignments when they keep on getting updated. And they cannot attend lectures on time because it is difficult for students to memorize the whole school schedule with meetings and events interrupting constantly.
This project intends to allow students to easily update their electronic calenders on their smart devices and pcs to set reminders for their whole semester of events and tasks.
The Solution will be a one-button app that will simply access a user's subjects and courses from the Ashesi Courseware/Record page after he or she has logged in and update his calender on his smart device.
The ease of access to the timetable will encourage more punctuality among users as they will have reminders for all the academic work and activities. Their academic standing will also benefit a lot.
Without this solution, students have to log into the Ashesi Courseware page via a Web browser and navigate through each course they have registered for and see at the Submission date and time. Then, Memorize it. Very Tedious.
